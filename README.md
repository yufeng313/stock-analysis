# All-Stocks-Analysis
## Overview of Project
Running an analysis of all stocks to help us better understanding "how actively tickers was traded" and "how different tickers performed" and in last few years. In this challenge, I'll use VBA code to automate tasks in a faster way.
## Analysis Results
In order to analysis all the dataset, here are some purpose we need to bring in mind:<br/>
1.Create arrays for tickers, tickerVolumes, tickerStartingPrices, and tickerEndingPrices.<br/>
2.Use for loop to caculate the total volume and year return for every tickers.<br/>
3.Use Timer function to know how fast VBA code will compile the results.<br/>
And here are the results with the VBA code:

### Compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.

## Summary
What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?

How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
